          <div class="comparison-item">
            <h3>Therapy</h3>
            <p>The domain of therapy is mental health and trauma, focusing on diagnosing and treatment. Here, we work with what's happening now and what you want next. This is not therapy.</p>
          </div>
          
          <!-- Coaching -->
          <div class="comparison-item">
            <h3>Coaching</h3>
            <p>Coaching typically means domain expertise and ongoing guidance—someone who knows your field and can direct you as long as you're working in it. This work is built differently: I help your own expertise emerge for what you're dealing with, then step away. The relationship is designed to end, not continue.</p>

          <!-- Consulting -->
          <div class="comparison-item">
            <h3>Consulting</h3>
            <p>Consulting is delegation of work and problem solving, handing the relevant work and decisions to the consultant who delivers solutions. Here, I help you regain comfort in handling your problems and help your own clarity return.</p>
