         WHY I DO THIS WORK
         Origin story with two friends
         ========================================== -->
    <section class="bg-cream animate-on-scroll">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Why I Do This Work</h2>
        
        <p>It started with two friends. One of them could see what his friend was capable of; the friend couldn't see it at all. I was thinking about it, and the way it sometimes happens, I was struck with an energizing idea I couldn't ignore. So I reached out to the friend who was stuck, and I offered to do this with him. Over time, he built new habits one small step at a time. He faced failures without letting them stop him. He chose to communicate even when it was difficult and he wouldn't have otherwise. He found joy in learning — not just in progress. He gave himself grace for things he would have felt guilty about. He created new systems. And he started to see what he was capable of. Between our calls and check-ins, I was thinking about him — how we were communicating, what direction to go next, what might help. I enjoyed the work itself, not just watching it produce results.</p>
        
        <p>Then I went about my life. As a parent and homeschool educator, I saw myself doing versions of the same thing. As a friend, I found myself offering a reframe or a question that visibly shifted something for them. It's not unusual for me to end a conversation with someone who came in a little heightened and leave them calmer. I'm wired to look for hidden blockers, unstated assumptions, unearned power dynamics. It kept showing up, unprompted, across enough contexts that I started to think: I'm already doing this. I enjoyed the formal version. I have evidence it works. Why not give it a try as a professional offering?</p>

         WHAT I BELIEVE
         Autonomy belief system
         ========================================== -->
    <section class="bg-cream animate-on-scroll">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>What I Believe</h2>
        
        <p>I believe there's a prevalence of limiting perspectives in society — people are patronized, talked down to, told what's best for them, and judged. I believe that has left a lot of people feeling helpless, incapable, or unmotivated. I believe in respecting the autonomy people already have — in encouraging them to make whatever decisions they think are best for them — not because it will necessarily lead to the right result right away, but because that's what allows them to act with conviction and then refine through learning.</p>
        
        <p>I'm here to offer ideas, tools, perspectives. You decide and act with your own judgment. From start to finish, you decide what's right. That respects you as the ultimate expert in your own life. I won't be offended if anything I offer is turned down — I'd actually prefer you told me directly, because that's how we move faster.</p>

         WHY ME

    <section class="bg-cream animate-on-scroll">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Why Me</h2>
        
        <p>I've always been a mix of logical and creative, with a tendency to think laterally. I refined the logical side through my education in computer science, with a focus on human-computer interaction — understanding how people actually think and act versus how systems assume they do. I refined my creativity through artistic and musical expression. I refined my ability to reach people through years of teaching, tutoring, and most recently homeschooling my own children. I can't help but reflect on experiences and try to learn from them.</p>
        
        <p>I don't see myself as special. I just think I have something useful to offer, and I'm here to offer it. It's how other people experience it that will tell you more than I can. As I work with more people, I'll share what they say. For now, a Fit Check is $50, and you leave with something useful regardless of whether we work together.</p>

    <section class="bg-cream animate-on-scroll">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        
        <p>I keep things simple and direct. I don't use jargon or frameworks unless they genuinely help. I celebrate what you learn from failure just as much as what you learn from success — and I'll ask you to celebrate with me.</p>
        
        <p>I work with very few people at a time. This lets me hold you in mind between our sessions and give you my full attention when we're together.</p>
        
        <p>Meetings can happen online, by phone, or in person, depending on what works best.</p>
