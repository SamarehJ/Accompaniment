           AGREEMENT
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>Agreement</h2>
      
      <p>By working together in any capacity, Fit Check, One-Time Session, or Ongoing Accompaniment. We're both agreeing to these terms. Please read them before we begin.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           WHAT I PROVIDE
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>What I Provide</h2>
      
      <p>I provide professional accompaniment, short-term, adaptive support while you rebuild clarity, momentum, and trust in your own judgment. This is not therapy, coaching, or consulting, and does not constitute medical, psychological, or legal advice. The specific structure and level of involvement for each engagement is agreed upon before work begins and documented in a cycle summary.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           WHAT I DON'T PROVIDE
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>What I Don't Provide</h2>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Clinical treatment, diagnosis, or mental health care</li>
        <li>Crisis intervention or emergency support</li>
        <li>Guarantees about outcomes</li>
        <li>Advice that substitutes for professional medical, legal, or financial guidance</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>If you need any of the above, I'd encourage you to seek support from a trained professional. See <a href="scope.html">Scope & Boundaries</a> for full details.</p>

           ENDING THE WORK
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>Ending the Work</h2>
      
      <p>Either of us can end the working relationship at any time. The only thing I ask is that we don't stop abruptly. We make space for at least one conversation about why, unless circumstances make that impossible. If I end the work, I'll explain why directly. If you end the work, I'll respect that without pressure.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      
      <p>This work is not a licensed professional service. I am not a therapist, counselor, coach, or medical provider. I cannot guarantee outcomes. The results of this work depend on your willingness to engage, try, and adjust, and on factors outside either of our control.</p>
      
      <p>I am not liable for:</p>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Decisions you make during or after our work together</li>
        <li>Outcomes that don't meet your expectations</li>

           NO GUARANTEE OF AVAILABILITY
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>No Guarantee of Availability</h2>
      
      <p>I work with very few people at a time. Availability is not guaranteed beyond what we've agreed to for a given cycle. I don't provide after-hours, on-call, or crisis support.</p>
