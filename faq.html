            <div class="faq-item">
              <p class="faq-question">What exactly is professional accompaniment?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>It's short-term human support while you rebuild clarity, momentum, and trust in your own judgment. I accompany you while you figure things out, using your own judgment. Then I step away once you don't need the support anymore.</p>
                <p>If you want someone else to make the decisions or be responsible for what happens, this won't be a good fit.</p>
              </div>

            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
              <p class="faq-question">Do I need to have a specific goal or problem to start?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>No. Some people come with a clear goal. Others just know something needs to change but can't articulate what. Part of the work is often clarifying what you actually want, which can't always be done by thinking harder. We figure it out through trying things and seeing what happens.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
              <p class="faq-question">How is this different from therapy?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Therapy focuses on diagnosis, treatment, and often explores your past to understand current patterns. Therapists are licensed mental health professionals trained to treat mental illness and trauma. I'm not a therapist and don't offer therapy. We work with what's happening now and what you want to happen next. If therapeutic support is what you need, I'd encourage you to seek support from a trained professional.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
              <p class="faq-question">Why not just call it coaching?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Coaching typically means someone with expertise in a domain—sports, career, leadership, productivity—who can guide you based on what's worked before. Coaching comes with expectations of specialized knowledge, preset methodology, performance optimization, and ongoing relationships. The coach is positioned as the authority you look to for direction, and you're expected to rely on that guidance for as long as you're working in that area. Success is measured by optimization metrics or SMART goals, focusing on outcomes and achievements.</p>
                <p>When people hire a coach, these qualities are usually what they want. This work is built differently. I'm not bound to a domain and will not position myself as the expert who instructs you on how to optimize in that domain; I'm here to help you develop your own expertise around what works for you in particular. Every attempt, whether it succeeds or fails, generates useful information—that's not an exception, it's how the work functions. Lack of failure is a lack of progress. That's why we celebrate failure alongside success as a source of learning, and derive joy from both. I'm not offering fixed packages that apply the same structures to different people; I work to find the minimum effective level of involvement for what you're dealing with specifically. We try things, see what happens, and learn from it together. My goal is explicitly for you to not need me: success is measured by the ease in which you move forward independently.</p>
                <p>If these differences sound frustrating, coaching might be a better fit. If they sound like relief, let's talk.</p>

              <p class="faq-question">What happens in a Fit Check?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>We talk for 30-45 minutes about where you are and what you're trying to figure out. You'll leave with at least one real insight or next step regardless.</p>

                <p>That's fine, and something we figure out in the Fit Check or early in the work. If I'm not the right person to support you, I'll tell you directly and I'd encourage you to seek support from a trained professional if that's what's needed.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <p class="faq-question">Can I just do one session?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. The One-Time Session is designed for exactly that: a standalone conversation for clarity.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
              <p class="faq-question">How long does this take?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>There's no fixed timeline. Work continues as long as it's useful and ends when you're ready to move forward on your own. Some people work with me for a few weeks. Others for several months. The goal is always to make myself obsolete as quickly as possible, without rushing.</p>
              </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <p class="faq-question">What does a typical cycle look like?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>There's no "typical." It depends on where you are and what would actually help. A cycle might include: One or two reflection/planning sessions, a few messages when questions come up, brief check-ins for accountability. Or it might include: Weekly sessions, daily brief calls or written check-ins, longer written exercises between sessions. We design this together based on what you need, try it, and adjust.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <p class="faq-question">Do you take insurance?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>No. This work is private pay only. Because this isn't therapy or a licensed clinical service, it's not covered by insurance.</p>

              <p class="faq-question">What if I can't afford your rates?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Current rates reflect a discount for early clients. If even these rates aren't feasible, we can discuss options, but I can't sustain offering this work for free.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. We'll need to discuss how to structure it and set ground rules first. Depending on the situation, I may meet with each of you individually as well as together.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>I can work with couples. We'd discuss how to structure the work and set ground rules together. I don't currently work with groups, but if you have a specific group in mind, we can discuss whether it would be a fit.</p>

              <p class="faq-question">What if I just need accountability, not the full accompaniment?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Accountability is often part of the work, but it's not a standalone service. If all you need is someone to check in with about specific habits or goals, there may be simpler (and cheaper) options better suited for that. If we discover during the Fit Check that accountability is all you need, I'll tell you and I'd encourage you to look into options better suited for that.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. Messages between sessions are part of most cycles, but the frequency and depth depend on what we've agreed to for that cycle. This isn't unlimited 24/7 access. I respond during business hours, typically within 24-48 hours.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>That's completely normal. Sometimes not knowing what to say is the most honest thing. We work with that. You don't need to come prepared with an agenda or update. If you're drawing a blank, we start there and see what emerges.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>We check in explicitly at the end of each cycle: Is this helping? Does the level of involvement feel right? Are you moving forward in a way that matters to you? If you're trusting yourself more, acting with more ease and less second-guessing, and needing less external structure, it's working. If not, we adjust or stop.</p>

                <p>You can end at any time. If we're in the middle of a cycle, we'll discuss what makes sense (refund, adjustment, or completing the cycle).

It's an optional touchpoint while you step into full independence, not a restart of ongoing work. Unlike a Fit Check or One-Time Session where we start from scratch, I already hold the full context of our work together. This is priced lower than other services partly as thanks for working with me and trusting the process. This is only available to people who have completed ongoing accompaniment (not just a Fit Check or One-Time Session).</p>

              <p class="faq-question">What if I want to come back after we've ended?</p>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>That's fine. Life changes, new blocks emerge. We'd start with another Fit Check to see if working together again makes sense, then proceed from there. The Safety Line is available for lighter touchpoints. If you need more substantial support again, we'd structure a new cycle.</p>
