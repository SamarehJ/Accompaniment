            <p>Sometimes the best way to understand what's blocking you is to observe you in your actual environment, at work, in your routine, in the context where you're stuck. I watch, take notes, and give you detailed feedback on what I see. This is only offered when the benefit is clear and we both agree it is worth the extra intensity and cost.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>The Work Moves Through States</h2>
        
        <p>Rather than a fixed timeline, the work moves through states that describe the kind of support you need. These can overlap, repeat briefly, or be skipped entirely.</p>
        
        <!-- States with Descriptions -->
        <div class="mt-lg">
          
          <!-- Finding Ground -->
          <div class="mb-lg">
            <h3>Finding Ground</h3>
            <p>We clarify what's actually going on, not just the surface problem, but what's underneath. We align on how we'll work together, set expectations around autonomy and exit, and try a small, real action to see what happens.</p>
          </div>
          
          <!-- Building Momentum -->
          <div class="mb-lg">
            <h3>Building Momentum</h3>
            <p>If momentum is low or you're genuinely stuck, I temporarily provide more structure, accountability, or presence. This state is intentionally supportive and intentionally temporary. Cycles here are often shorter, weekly or biweekly, to establish rhythm quickly.</p>
          </div>
          
          <!-- Steady Progress -->
          <div class="mb-lg">
            <h3>Steady Progress</h3>
            <p>We run ongoing Plan-Act-Reflect cycles. Structure stays only where it helps. Advice may be offered as experiments, never mandates. Reflection deepens. You increasingly steer the work yourself. Cycles here are typically monthly.</p>
          </div>
          
          <!-- Letting Go -->
          <div class="mb-lg">
            <h3>Letting Go</h3>
            <p>Support is deliberately reduced. Reflection and planning shift to you. We name what you can now do without me and celebrate both progress and missteps. Dependency is actively dismantled here. This is the only required state before ending. We don't just stop; we intentionally ramp down.</p>
          </div>
          
        </div>
        
        <p>Ending support can feel both satisfying and unsettling—and we make space for both.</p>

        <p>"Failure" isn't a setback. It's data that tells us what to try next. Success isn't the only thing worth noting. Progress isn't linear, and that's expected, not a problem.</p>
        
        <p>We celebrate discovering what doesn't work just as much as discovering what does. The point is learning and moving forward, not perfection.</p>
