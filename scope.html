           WHAT THIS WORK IS FOR
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>What This Work Is For</h2>
      
      <p>This work is for people who are stuck, between knowing and acting, or between wanting change and making it happen.</p>
      
      <p>It's appropriate when you:</p>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Feel blocked or paralyzed despite being generally capable</li>
        <li>Have lost clarity about what you actually want</li>
        <li>Know what needs to happen but can't seem to start</li>
        <li>Are spinning without making meaningful progress</li>
        <li>Are navigating a specific transition and need outside perspective</li>
        <li>Want support without being managed or optimized</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The common thread isn't a specific problem type. It's a willingness to try small actions, reflect honestly on what happens, and gradually take ownership of the process.</p>
      
      <p>If you solve one problem and later find yourself stuck in a new area, we can work together again. Each engagement is scoped to what you're actually dealing with, not an open-ended relationship.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           WHAT THIS WORK IS NOT FOR
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>What This Work Is Not For</h2>
      
      <p><strong>This is not therapy.</strong> I'm not a licensed mental health professional and don't provide clinical treatment, diagnosis, or care for mental illness.</p>
      
      <p>If you need any of the following, clinical support from a licensed professional is what you need:</p>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Treatment for mental illness, trauma, or conditions requiring clinical care</li>
        <li>Crisis intervention or active support for suicidal thoughts</li>
        <li>Diagnosis or medication management</li>
        <li>Ongoing mental health maintenance or symptom management</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This work is also not a fit if you:</p>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Want someone to take responsibility for your outcomes</li>
        <li>Prefer to be told what to do rather than discovering it yourself</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This isn't a judgment about you—it's about matching the right kind of support to what you actually need.</p>
      
      <p>If clinical support is what you need, I'd encourage you to seek support from a trained professional. If you're already working with a therapist and want accompaniment for specific non-clinical goals, we can discuss whether that makes sense.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           WHEN I REFER OUT
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>When I Refer Out</h2>
      
      <p>I'll suggest that you seek support from a trained professional if:</p>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>The work consistently isn't helping and a different approach seems needed</li>
        <li>Your situation is outside my scope of competence</li>
        <li>We're not a good interpersonal fit</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>If you need clinical mental health treatment or are in crisis, that's covered in 'What This Work Is Not For' above.</p>
      
      <p>This isn't failure—it's clarity. Finding the right kind of support matters more than making any particular relationship work.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           CRISIS AND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS
           ========================================== -->
      <h2 id="crisis">Crisis and Emergency Situations</h2>
      
      <p>This work is not crisis intervention or emergency support.</p>
      
      <p>If you're in immediate danger or experiencing a mental health crisis:</p>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Call 911</li>
        <li>Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988</li>
        <li>Go to your nearest emergency room</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>I'm available during our scheduled sessions and through agreed-upon messaging, but I cannot provide urgent or after-hours crisis support. If a crisis emerges between our sessions, please use the resources above.</p>

           MY QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITS
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>My Qualifications and Limits</h2>
      
      <p>I have an MS in Computer Science with coursework in human-computer interaction, experience as a homeschool educator and teaching assistant, and confidence in my ability to provide this kind of support.</p>
      
      <p>I am not a licensed therapist, psychologist, counselor, or medical provider.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What I can offer:</strong></p>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Structured reflection and planning support</li>
        <li>Accompaniment through trying new actions and learning from results</li>
        <li>Perspective and accountability while you rebuild clarity and momentum</li>
        <li>Clear boundaries and honest assessment of whether this work is helping</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>I stay within my competence and will encourage you to seek support from a trained professional when something requires expertise I don't have.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           WORKING ALONGSIDE OTHER PROFESSIONALS
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>Working Alongside Other Professionals</h2>
      
      <p>You can work with me while also working with a therapist, psychiatrist, doctor, or other professional, as long as the goals and scope are clearly different.</p>
      
      <p>For example:</p>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Therapy addresses mental health treatment; this work addresses specific life transitions or goals</li>
        <li>A psychiatrist manages medication; this work helps you build habits that medication alone can't create</li>
        <li>Medical care handles diagnosis and treatment; this work helps you implement behavior changes your doctor recommended</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>If you're working with other professionals, I may ask you to let them know you're also working with me, especially if our work might overlap with their treatment.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           WHAT WE LOOK OUT FOR
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>What We Look Out For</h2>
      
      <p>Early in the work, it's normal and expected for you to lean on me more heavily. That's part of how momentum gets started. Over time, the goal is for that reliance to shift back to you, and we look out for that shift together.</p>
      
      <p>If any of these come up, we address them directly:</p>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Reliance on me is staying high or increasing past the early stages when it's expected</li>
        <li>You're consistently looking to me to make decisions rather than building your own judgment</li>
        <li>The work isn't helping and we can't identify useful adjustments</li>
        <li>You need clinical support that's outside my scope</li>
        <li>Our working relationship has become problematic in a way we can't resolve</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This isn't about fault or failure—it's about keeping the work useful. If something isn't serving you, we change course or stop.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           CONFIDENTIALITY AND ITS LIMITS
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>Confidentiality and Its Limits</h2>
      
      <p>What we discuss stays confidential with a few legal exceptions:</p>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>If you disclose abuse or neglect of a child, elderly person, or dependent adult, I'm legally required to report it</li>
        <li>If I believe you or someone else is in immediate danger, I'll involve appropriate professionals or authorities</li>
        <li>If required by a court order</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>For more details, see the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="../faq.html">FAQ</a>.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           THIS ISN'T COMPREHENSIVE
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>This Isn't Comprehensive</h2>
      
      <p>These boundaries describe common situations, but they can't cover everything. If something comes up that seems outside the scope of this work or my competence, I'll say so directly. When in doubt, we talk about it.</p>
