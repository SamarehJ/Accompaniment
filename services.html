        <h3>Ongoing Accompaniment — Quoted per cycle</h3>
        
        <p>Work happens in renewable cycles with adaptive involvement. We start with a best guess about what will help, try it, and adjust as we go.</p>
        
        <p>Before beginning ongoing work, we'll have a <strong>Groundwork session</strong>, a 90-minute conversation to explore your situation, set expectations, and determine how to structure the first cycle. The time for this session is included in your first cycle quote.</p>
        
        <!-- How Pricing is Determined -->
        <div class="mt-lg">
          <h3>How pricing is determined</h3>
          <p>Ongoing accompaniment is quoted per cycle based on the level of involvement that would actually help right now, and the length of the cycle (often monthly, sometimes shorter early on).</p>
          
          <p>I'll propose a clear structure and price before each cycle begins. Nothing renews automatically, as each cycle will be unique to where you are with your situation. </p>
          
          <p>If at any point the level of involvement feels like too much or not enough, we adjust.</p>

        <h3>Safety Line — $30</h3>
        
        <p>After our work together ends, you can pay for the option to reach out once during the month, for reassurance, a quick question, or brief recalibration. You might not need it, but it's there if you do.</p>
        
        <p>Available only to those who have completed ongoing accompaniment work. This is not restarting the relationship. It's a light touchpoint while you step fully into independence. This is priced lower than other services partly as thanks for working with me and trusting the process.</p>
