      <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
      
      <p>This work relies on mutual respect for time, attention, and commitment. The policy below reflects that, while allowing for real life when it intervenes.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           SESSION CANCELLATIONS
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>Session Cancellations</h2>
      
      <p><strong>24+ hours' notice:</strong> No charge. The session can be rescheduled within the same cycle when possible, or credited toward the next cycle.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Less than 24 hours' notice:</strong> 50% of the session fee is charged. This reflects preparation already done and reserved time that cannot realistically be rebooked.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Same-day cancellation or no-show (including "I forgot"):</strong> The full session fee is charged. At that point, the time has been fully held for you and cannot be used elsewhere. "Same-day" means any cancellation within 12 hours of the scheduled start time.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           CYCLE CANCELLATIONS
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>Cycle Cancellations</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Before a cycle begins (after payment):</strong> Full refund, minus any completed work (such as a Fit Check, Groundwork session, or preparation already done for the cycle, calculated at the time invested).</p>
      
      <p><strong>During the first week of a cycle:</strong> A prorated refund for undelivered services, based on the time and sessions actually used.</p>
      
      <p><strong>After the first week:</strong> No refunds. We can adjust scope, intensity, or pause the work, but payment stands for the commitment and time set aside for you.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           EMERGENCIES
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>Emergencies</h2>
      
      <p>Genuine emergencies (such as sudden illness, family emergency, or acute personal crises) will be handled with flexibility on a case-by-case basis. If you're unsure whether something counts as an emergency, please let me know what happened and we'll decide together. The intent of this policy is not to penalize you for real life, but to protect both of our time and capacity.</p>
      
      
      <!-- ==========================================
           RESCHEDULING
           ========================================== -->
      <h2>Rescheduling</h2>
      
      <p>Sessions may be rescheduled at no charge with 24+ hours' notice. When possible, we will find an alternative time within the same cycle. If that is not possible, the session may be credited toward the next cycle at my discretion.</p>
